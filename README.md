custom raspberry pi pico-based keyboard to fit into a vintage Smith Corona digital typewriter

# The Idea:
The initial idea came as an inspiration from the Cyberdeck community and a free typewriter I got at an antiques show. This is just the keyboard part of the whole project.

Originally, I planned on repurposing the keyboard that it came with, but that proved to be too challenging, as it would require reverse engineering the strange pcb and creating a new connector, and it would just be easier to design and make a brand-new keyboard pcb for the project.

# The Planning
I started by first figuring out the layout, using the online Keyboard Layout Editor (KLE) and using the origional keyboard as a reference. "Image"
